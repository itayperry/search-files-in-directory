# search-files-in-directory (with Node.js)

Place this file in the main directory that you would like to conduct a search in. 
Using a specific extension and a string with a search value you could search for relevant files that you need in that directory and its subdirectories.

## Example: node search.js html user

This would search all the js files that contain the string 'user' (the search is case-insensitive).
